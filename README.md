# airphaneDijkstraShortestPath
A group final project in the Introduction of Data Structure class

Simulate with the raw airline data to find the shortest path between airports by using Dijkstra algorithm in c++ and QtGUI
Raw airline and airport data are provided by openflight

Outcome of the project: - A study of basic graph structure
                        - Understanding the idea of Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path
                        - Experience the QtGUI
